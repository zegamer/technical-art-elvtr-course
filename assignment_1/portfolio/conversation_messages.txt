Okay, so where were we?
Oh yeah!
You ever watched How I Met Your Mother?
Dude, you have to. Absolute classic
So there's this guy, Ted
He's telling his kids this super long story
Like, nine seasons long
All about how he met their mom
But here's the thing - he takes forever to get to it
Meanwhile, he's got his squad
First, there's Marshall
Big, goofy, total sweetheart
Engaged to Lily, his college sweetheart
Lily? Kindergarten teacher, but low-key terrifying
They're that couple who never breaks up
Then there's Barney
Oh man, Barney Stinson
Suit-wearing, catchphrase-dropping legend
Lives by the Bro Code
No one knows what his job is
Then there's Robin
Canadian, news anchor, secretly a former teen pop star
Ted falls hard for her
But - plot twist - she's not the mother
They date, break up, stay friends
Meanwhile, they all basically live at MacLaren's
That's their bar
Ted keeps dating random women
And making terrible decisions
Marshall and Lily get married
Barney keeps being Barney
Robin keeps crushing it at work
Ted? Still searching
Then he meets her
The Mother
Her name's Tracy
She's perfect for him
They fall in love
They have kids
And then - well
She dies
Yeah. It's rough
And then Ted realizes something
This whole story?
It was actually about Robin
So he goes back to her
Blue French horn and all
That's How I Met Your Mother
Classic show, man. You'd love it
Oh wait - did I spoil it?
Oops
Anyway, you have to watch it


Um!


No one ever reached the end


I guess thanks for staying
